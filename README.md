# banshee-remote

Source code for the (now pretty much obsolete) Banshee remote. This app was created when personal mp3 libraries where a thing and Android was pretty new and I had time to work on random things. The code itself is pretty terrible, but I thought I'd push it out now that I'm stuck inside due to corona in case it's ever useful again for anything.

Banshee was/is a media player which used to be the default player on Ubuntu and I grew quite fond of it. So I took an extension which had been developed for Rhythmbox and adapted for Banshee. 

The source code consists of two folders

* BansheeRemote : The source code for the Android app
* banshee-remote-plugin : Source code for the extension to the Banshee player itself to allow it to interact with the app
